# Hostel Contact Page Documentation

## Project Overview
This document pertains to the `contact.html` file, which serves as the "About Hostel" page within the Hostel Management System project. The page is designed to provide critical information about the hostel, including its mission, location, contact details, brand message, social media presence, and a copyright notice.

## Key Features
- **Hostel Description**: Outlines the hostel’s purpose, offering a secure and comfortable environment for students, complete with amenities such as furnished rooms, 24/7 security, high-speed internet, and hygienic dining facilities.
- **Location Details**: Specifies the hostel’s address for easy reference.
- **Contact Information**: Lists the hostel’s email address, phone number, and operational hours for administrative inquiries.
- **Brand Messaging**: Features the hostel’s tagline, reinforcing its commitment to being a supportive home for students.
- **Social Media Integration**: Provides hyperlinks to the hostel’s official Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter accounts, configured to open in new browser tabs.
- **Dynamic Footer**: Includes a copyright notice that automatically updates to reflect the current year.
- **Styling**: Utilizes inline CSS to ensure a professional and consistent presentation, with a clean layout, Arial font, navy blue hyperlinks, and appropriate spacing.

## File Structure
- **contact.html**: Contains the HTML structure, embedded CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamically rendering content.

## Implementation Instructions
1. Open the `contact.html` file in a web browser to view the page.
2. Ensure JavaScript is enabled, as the page relies on JavaScript to populate content dynamically from the `hostelData` object.
3. Social media links are set to open in new tabs using the `target="_blank"` attribute for improved user experience.

## Dependencies
- This page has no external dependencies and is built using standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Guidelines for Collaborators
- **Content Updates**: The `hostelData` object within the JavaScript section can be modified to reflect accurate hostel information, such as updated contact details or social media URLs.
- **Styling Adjustments**: The CSS can be refined or aligned with the broader project’s design system to ensure visual consistency.
- **Integration**: Ensure this page is appropriately linked within the navigation structure of the Hostel Management System.
- **Testing**: Verify functionality across different browsers to confirm consistent rendering and link behavior.
